            <h2>About Me</h2>
          </header>

          <p>
            Hi, I’m Sidney — a vocalist, songwriter, and actor based in Folkestone.
            I’ve spent years performing across the UK, working on TV and radio,
            collaborating with bands and artists, and developing my sound in studios
            and live settings. Music isn’t just something I do — it’s the world I
            live in every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve trained with some of the UK’s leading vocal coaches, including
            Kate Cameron, Gareth Malone, Nicola Palmer, and ILĀ. Their guidance
            helped me develop a technique that’s expressive, flexible, and rooted in
            real artistry rather than rigid rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            I now bring all of that experience into my teaching — whether that’s
            helping someone strengthen their voice, shape a song they’re writing, or
            record vocals in a way that finally captures how they feel when they sing.
          </p>

          <div class="about-offer">
            <h3>What I Offer</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Vocal coaching (technique, tone, texture, control, confidence)</li>
              <li>Songwriting support (lyrics, melody, structure, creative flow)</li>
              <li>Performance training (auditions, gigs, storytelling, presence)</li>
              <li>Recording guidance (capturing vocals, phrasing, expression)</li>
              <li>Production feedback &amp; shaping your sound</li>

              clear, practical technique, tone and texture that feel personal to you,
              and creativity at the heart of everything. I’m not a “by the book”
              coach — I meet you exactly where you are.

              “Sidney creates a safe, encouraging space where you're never pressured
              but always supported.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Working with Sidney as my vocal coach has been an absolute joy. Not
              only is he a phenomenal singer with a brilliant ear for music, but
              he also brings a deep sense of understanding, empathy, and fun to
              every session. His musicianship is outstanding, but what really sets
              him apart is the way he tailors his teaching to each individual.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sidney creates a safe, encouraging space where you're never pressured
              but always supported. He listens carefully to your voice, helps you
              discover what works for you, and celebrates your progress every step
              of the way. His positive reinforcement is genuinely uplifting, and
              when there’s something to improve, he approaches it with kindness
              and clarity: “This is what we’ll work on, and we’ll get there together.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He’s helped me not only with technique—like pitch matching, vocal
              closure, and blending head and chest voice—but also with performance
              confidence and ear training. He breaks things down in a way that’s
              easy to understand and makes you feel capable, not self-conscious.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sidney is not just a gifted vocalist and teacher—he’s also great fun
              to be around. I’m so glad I found him, and I’m incredibly proud to
              be his first client. I look forward to continuing our work together
              and can’t wait to make my debut performance with his guidance behind me.

        </header>

        <div class="faq-grid">
          <details>
            <summary>Do you teach complete beginners?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. Many of my students start with little or no formal experience.
              We’ll go at your pace, focusing on confidence, basics, and building
              a healthy relationship with your voice.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What styles of music do you teach?</summary>
            <p>
              I’m a multi-genre vocalist with a background in musical theatre,
              bands, and contemporary styles. We can explore anything from pop,
              indie, and rock to more theatrical or experimental approaches.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Where do lessons take place?</summary>
            <p>
              I teach from a private studio space in Folkestone with access to
              professional recording equipment. Online sessions may also be
              available on request.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Do you offer online lessons?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes, online lessons can be arranged if you’re not local or prefer
              working remotely. We’ll make sure the setup works for both of us so
              you still get clear, effective feedback.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Can you help with songwriting and recording?</summary>
            <p>
              Absolutely. I regularly work with students on their original songs,
              helping with lyrics, melody, structure, and performance. I also
              offer guidance on recording vocals and shaping your sound.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What is your cancellation policy?</summary>
            <p>
              I usually ask for at least 24 hours’ notice if you need to cancel
              or reschedule a session. This keeps the schedule fair and allows
              that slot to be offered to someone else.
