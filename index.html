        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Sidney — a vocalist, songwriter, and actor based in Folkestone.
          I’ve spent years performing across the UK, working on TV and radio,
          collaborating with bands and artists, and developing my sound in studios
          and live settings. Music isn’t just something I do — it’s the world I live
          in every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve trained with some of the UK’s leading vocal coaches – including
          Kate Cameron, Gareth Malone, Nicola Palmer and ILĀ – and their guidance
          helped me develop a technique that’s expressive, flexible, and rooted in
          real artistry rather than rigid rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          I bring all of that experience into my teaching — whether that’s
          strengthening your voice, shaping a song you’re writing, or recording
          vocals in a way that finally feels like you.
        </p>
        <ul class="about-list">

            Working with Sidney as my vocal coach has been an absolute joy. Not only
            is he a phenomenal singer with a brilliant ear for music, but he also
            brings a deep sense of understanding, empathy, and fun to every session.
            His musicianship is outstanding, but what really sets him apart is the
            way he tailors his teaching to each individual.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sidney creates a safe, encouraging space where you're never pressured
            but always supported. He listens carefully to your voice, helps you
            discover what works for you, and celebrates your progress every step of
            the way. His positive reinforcement is genuinely uplifting, and when
            there’s something to improve, he approaches it with kindness and
            clarity: “This is what we’ll work on, and we’ll get there together.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He’s helped me not only with technique — like pitch matching, vocal
            closure, and blending head and chest voice — but also with performance
            confidence and ear training. He breaks things down in a way that’s easy
            to understand and makes you feel capable, not self-conscious.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sidney is not just a gifted vocalist and teacher — he’s also great fun
            to be around. I’m so glad I found him, and I’m incredibly proud to be
            his first client. I look forward to continuing our work together and
            can’t wait to make my debut performance with his guidance behind me.

        <article class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do I need any experience to start lessons?</h3>
          <p>
            Not at all. I work with complete beginners through to advanced singers.
            We’ll start from where you are and build from there at a pace that feels
            comfortable and encouraging.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do you teach online as well as in person?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. I offer both in-person sessions in Folkestone and online lessons via
            video call. Online lessons follow the same structure and are great if
            you’re further away or prefer working from home.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can we work on my original songs as well as covers?</h3>
          <p>
            Absolutely. I love supporting songwriters. We can shape lyrics, melody
            and structure, as well as how you deliver the song vocally and
            emotionally.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do you help with recording and studio confidence?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. I have access to professional recording equipment and we can use
            sessions to practise studio technique, phrasing, mic control and
            building confidence in front of the microphone.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do I pay for lessons?</h3>
          <p>
            Payment is usually made by bank transfer in advance of each session or
            package. Full details are provided when you book.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="faq-item">
          <h3>What is your cancellation policy?</h3>
          <p>
            I ask for at least 24 hours’ notice for cancellations or rescheduling
            where possible. With less than 24 hours’ notice, the full fee may still
            be payable, as it’s unlikely I’ll be able to offer the slot to another
            student.
