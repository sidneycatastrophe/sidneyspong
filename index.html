          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I’m Sidney — a vocalist, songwriter, and actor based in Folkestone.
            I’ve spent years performing across the UK, working on TV and radio,
            collaborating with bands and artists, and developing my sound in studios
            and live settings. Music isn’t just something I do — it’s the world I
            live in every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve trained with some of the UK’s leading vocal coaches – including
            Kate Cameron, Gareth Malone, Nicola Palmer and ILĀ – and their guidance
            helped me develop a technique that’s expressive, flexible, and rooted in
            real artistry rather than rigid rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            I bring all of that experience into my teaching — whether that’s
            strengthening your voice, shaping a song you’re writing, or recording
            vocals in a way that finally feels like you.

            <p>
              Working with Sidney as my vocal coach has been an absolute joy.
              Not only is he a phenomenal singer with a brilliant ear for music,
              but he also brings a deep sense of understanding, empathy, and fun to
              every session. His musicianship is outstanding, but what really sets
              him apart is the way he tailors his teaching to each individual.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sidney creates a safe, encouraging space where you're never pressured
              but always supported. He listens carefully to your voice, helps you
              discover what works for you, and celebrates your progress every step
              of the way. His positive reinforcement is genuinely uplifting, and
              when there’s something to improve, he approaches it with kindness and
              clarity: “This is what we’ll work on, and we’ll get there together.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He’s helped me not only with technique — like pitch matching, vocal
              closure, and blending head and chest voice — but also with performance
              confidence and ear training. He breaks things down in a way that’s
              easy to understand and makes you feel capable, not self-conscious.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sidney is not just a gifted vocalist and teacher — he’s also great fun
              to be around. I’m so glad I found him, and I’m incredibly proud to be
              his first client. I look forward to continuing our work together and
              can’t wait to make my debut performance with his guidance behind me.

            <h3>Do I need any experience to start lessons?</h3>
            <p>
              Not at all. I work with complete beginners through to advanced
              singers. We’ll start from where you are and build from there at a
              pace that feels comfortable and encouraging.

          <article class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do you teach online as well as in person?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. I offer both in-person sessions in Folkestone and online
              lessons via video call. Online lessons follow the same structure and
              are great if you’re further away or prefer working from home.

          <article class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can we work on my original songs as well as covers?</h3>
            <p>
              Absolutely. I love supporting songwriters. We can shape lyrics,
              melody and structure, as well as how you deliver the song vocally
              and emotionally.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do you help with recording and studio confidence?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. I have access to professional recording equipment and we can
              use sessions to practise studio technique, phrasing, mic control and
              building confidence in front of the microphone.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I pay for lessons?</h3>
            <p>
              Payment is usually made by bank transfer in advance of each session
              or package. Full details are provided when you book.

          <article class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is your cancellation policy?</h3>
            <p>
              I ask for at least 24 hours’ notice for cancellations or
              rescheduling where possible. With less than 24 hours’ notice, the
              full fee may still be payable, as it’s unlikely I’ll be able to
              offer the slot to another student.
