          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I’m Sidney — a vocalist, songwriter, and actor based in
            <strong>Folkestone</strong>. I’ve spent years performing across the UK, working on TV
            and radio, collaborating with bands and artists, and developing my sound in
            studios and live settings. Music isn’t just something I do — it’s the world I
            live in every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve trained with some of the UK’s leading vocal coaches – including
            <strong>Kate Cameron, Gareth Malone, Nicola Palmer and ILĀ</strong> – and their
            guidance helped me develop a technique that’s expressive, flexible, and rooted
            in real artistry rather than rigid rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            I bring all of that experience into my teaching, whether that’s strengthening
            your voice, shaping a song you’re writing, or recording vocals in a way that
            finally feels like <em>you</em>.
          </p>

                Working with Sidney as my vocal coach has been an absolute joy. Not only
                is he a phenomenal singer with a brilliant ear for music, but he also
                brings a deep sense of understanding, empathy, and fun to every session.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sidney creates a safe, encouraging space where you're never pressured but
                always supported. He listens carefully to your voice, helps you discover
                what works for you, and celebrates your progress every step of the way.
                His positive reinforcement is genuinely uplifting, and when there’s
                something to improve, he approaches it with kindness and clarity:
                “This is what we’ll work on, and we’ll get there together.”
              </p>
              <p>
                He’s helped me not only with technique — like pitch matching, vocal
                closure, and blending head and chest voice — but also with performance
                confidence and ear training. He breaks things down in a way that’s easy
                to understand and makes you feel capable, not self-conscious.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sidney is not just a gifted vocalist and teacher — he’s also great fun to
                be around. I’m so glad I found him, and I’m incredibly proud to be his
                first client. I look forward to continuing our work together and can’t
                wait to make my debut performance with his guidance behind me.

          <details>
            <summary>Do I need any experience to start lessons?</summary>
            <p>
              Not at all. I work with complete beginners through to advanced singers.
              We’ll start from where you are and build from there at a pace that feels
              comfortable and encouraging.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Do you teach online as well as in person?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. I offer both in-person sessions in Folkestone and online lessons via
              video call. Online lessons follow the same structure and are great if
              you’re further away or prefer working from home.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Can we work on my original songs as well as covers?</summary>
            <p>
              Absolutely. I love supporting songwriters. We can shape lyrics, melody and
              structure, as well as how you deliver the song vocally and emotionally.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>Do you help with recording and studio confidence?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. I have access to professional recording equipment and we can use
              sessions to practise studio technique, phrasing, mic control and building
              confidence in front of the microphone.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>How do I pay for lessons?</summary>
            <p>
              Payment is usually made by bank transfer in advance of each session or
              package. Full details are provided when you book.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary>What is your cancellation policy?</summary>
            <p>
              I ask for at least 24 hours’ notice for cancellations or rescheduling
              where possible. With less than 24 hours’ notice, the full fee may still be
              payable, as it’s unlikely I’ll be able to offer the slot to another
              student.
