          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I’m Sidney — a vocalist, songwriter, and actor based in Folkestone.
            I’ve spent years performing across the UK, working on TV and radio,
            collaborating with bands and artists, and developing my sound in studios
            and live settings. Music isn’t just something I do — it’s the world I live in every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve trained with some of the UK’s leading vocal coaches, including
            Kate Cameron, Gareth Malone, Nicola Palmer, and ILĀ. Their guidance helped me
            develop a technique that’s expressive, flexible, and rooted in real artistry
            rather than rigid rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            I now bring all of that experience into my teaching — whether that’s helping
            someone strengthen their voice, shape a song they’re writing, or record vocals
            in a way that finally captures how they feel when they sing.
          </p>

            <p>
              Working with Sidney as my vocal coach has been an absolute joy. Not only is he a
              phenomenal singer with a brilliant ear for music, but he also brings a deep sense
              of understanding, empathy, and fun to every session. His musicianship is outstanding,
              but what really sets him apart is the way he tailors his teaching to each individual.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sidney creates a safe, encouraging space where you're never pressured but always supported.
              He listens carefully to your voice, helps you discover what works for you, and celebrates
              your progress every step of the way. His positive reinforcement is genuinely uplifting, and
              when there’s something to improve, he approaches it with kindness and clarity:
              “This is what we’ll work on, and we’ll get there together.”
            </p>
            <p>
              He’s helped me not only with technique—like pitch matching, vocal closure, and blending head
              and chest voice—but also with performance confidence and ear training. He breaks things down
              in a way that’s easy to understand and makes you feel capable, not self-conscious.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sidney is not just a gifted vocalist and teacher—he’s also great fun to be around.
              I’m so glad I found him, and I’m incredibly proud to be his first client. I look forward
              to continuing our work together and can’t wait to make my debut performance with his
              guidance behind me.
